### About

Blackstar Navigator is an open source navigation and order management app for drivers and agents. This app is fully customizable and supports QR code scanning, digital signatures, photos, and routing and navigation for agents. Drivers can update activity to orders on the run as they complete jobs. The app includes fuel report and issue management, plus built-in chat with operations personnel and customers.

### Prerequisites

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- Xcode 12+
- Android Studio

### Installation

Installation and setup is fairly quick, all you need is your API key and a few commands to get your app running in minutes. Follow the directions below to get started.

Run the commands below; first clone the project, use npm or yarn to install the dependencies, then run `npx pod-install` to install the iOS dependencies. Lastly, create a `.env` file to configure the app.

```
git clone git@github.com:Blackmarket-coa/Blackstar.git
cd Blackstar
yarn
yarn pod:install
touch .env
```

### Configure Environment

Below is the steps needed to configure the environment. The first part covers collecting your required API keys.

1.  Get your API Keys;
2.  If you don't already have an account for your backend instance, create one from your provider's console.
3.  Once you're in the Blackstar gateway admin console, create an API key for the mobile app and copy the secret value.
4.  Once you have the required API keys, open your `.env` file.

In your `.env` file supply your API secret key, and additionally a Google Maps API key. Lastly, set your app/bundle identifier and an `APP_NAME` key.

Your `.env` file should look something like this once you're done.

```
# .env
APP_NAME=Blackstar Navigator
APP_IDENTIFIER=com.blackmarket.blackstar
APP_LINK_PREFIX=blackstar://
BLACKSTAR_GATEWAY_HOST=https://api.blackmarket.coa
BLACKSTAR_GATEWAY_KEY=
BLACKSTAR_SOCKET_HOST=socket.blackmarket.coa
BLACKSTAR_SOCKET_PORT=8000
BLACKSTAR_SOCKET_SECURE=true
```

### Running in Simulator

Once you have completed the installation and environment configuration, you're all set to give your app a test-drive in the simulator so you can play around.

#### Run the App in iOS Simulator

```
yarn ios
```

#### Run the App in Android Simulator

```
yarn android
```

### Documentation

See the Blackstar internal documentation and API runbooks for environment-specific setup.

If you contribute to this app, keep feature parity aligned with the Blackstar gateway contracts and release checklist.
